This leaves some freedom for the corresponding eigenvectors as the only requirement is that they are in the plane and are orthogonal.​ Geometrically, the equation x 1plusx 2minusx 3equals0 represents a plane and any 2 orthogonal vectors on that plane can be used as eigenvectors.Part 6For this​ problem, we will use Bold v 1equalsStart 3 By 1 Table 1st Row 1st Column 1 2nd Row 1st Column 0 3rd Row 1st Column 1 EndTable	 as the​ first, unnormalized eigenvector. There are multiple ways to find a vector Bold v 2 that is orthogonal to Bold v 1 and also lies in the given plane. One method is to find another vector w in the plane​ (that is not a multiple of Bold v 1​) and subtract its orthogonal projection onto the first vector to obtain an orthogonal vector Bold v 2.
